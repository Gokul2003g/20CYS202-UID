<h1>UI Evaluation of AUMS website</h1>

- The website is intended to be used by college students of Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham Coimbatore campus.

<h3>Login Page</h3>

<img src="">

Strength of the page is the use of clear and concise headings and labels to guide the user through the login process. The page also has a clean and modern design, with a consistent layout and good use of white space.

However, there are a few areas where the page could be improved. The page could benefit from more visual hierarchy, with the use of different font sizes, colors, and other design elements to help guide the user's attention. Additionally, the page could be more mobile-friendly, as it is currently not optimized for smaller screens.

Another area for improvement is the use of error messages. Currently, the page does not provide any feedback if the user enters an incorrect username or password. It would be helpful to have clear and specific error messages to let the user know what went wrong and how to fix it.

Hence to conclude with the Login page it is functional.

<h3>Home Page</h3>

 - The top section consists of links to individual subjects.

    All the sections have a button to copy the link to the current page, a help button which opens the AUMS user guide
